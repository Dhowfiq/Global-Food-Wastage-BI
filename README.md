🌎🍽️ Global Food Data Analysis Dashboard
📊 Project Overview
This project provides an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of global food data using Power BI. The dashboard delivers deep insights into global food production, consumption, and trends, enabling users to explore metrics like food availability, nutritional content, and regional comparisons.

🚀 Key Features
✅ Production & Consumption Trends: Visualized production and consumption of various food categories globally and by country.

✅ Nutritional Analysis: Explored caloric value, protein, and fat content across different food types.

✅ Country Comparisons: Analyzed food production and supply across regions and countries.

✅ Interactive Filters: Slicers for country, food category, and time to dynamically explore insights.

✅ Key Indicators: Tracked KPIs such as total production, per capita availability, and food balance sheets.

🗄️ Dataset Overview
