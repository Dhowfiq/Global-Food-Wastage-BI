Global Food Wastage Analysis with Power BI
A comprehensive Power BI dashboard project for exploratory data analysis (EDA) of global food wastage data, highlighting key trends, metrics, and visualizations to support social and economic sustainability efforts.

Project Overview
This project leverages Power BI to analyze and visualize global food wastage data from 2018 to 2024. The dashboard enables users to explore food waste trends by category, region, and year, providing actionable insights into economic loss, population impact, and waste distribution. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, includes metrics such as total wastage (tons), economic loss (million USD), average waste per capita, population (millions), and household waste percentage.

Features
Key Metrics (KPIs):

Average waste per capita

Total economic loss (in millions)

Total population (in millions)

Total waste (in tons)

Household waste percentage

Interactive Filters:

Food Category (e.g., Bakery, Beverages, Dairy, etc.)

Country

Year (2018–2024, with range selection)

Visualizations:

KPI cards for quick metric overviews

Donut chart for waste by food category

Clustered column and line chart for population and household waste by category

Filled map for country-wise economic loss (with conditional color formatting)

Scatter plot for relationship between total waste and economic loss

Custom Styling:

Themed color palettes

Visual borders, shadows, and rounded corners for enhanced readability

Responsive design for slicers and filters
